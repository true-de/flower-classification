# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 1. Create a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Enter the repository name: `flower-classification`
4. Add a description: "A deep learning project for classifying flowers using CNN with a Streamlit web interface"
5. Choose public or private visibility based on your preference
6. Check the box to initialize the repository with a README (optional)
7. Click 'Create repository'

## 2. Upload Project Files

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Navigate to your newly created repository
2. Click on 'Add file' > 'Upload files'
3. Drag and drop all the project files or use the file selector
4. Add a commit message like "Initial commit: Upload flower classification project"
5. Click 'Commit changes'

### Option 2: Using Git Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd e:\pyth\aigen\flower_classification

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Upload flower classification project"

# Add the remote repository URL (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/flower-classification.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# If you encounter permission issues, you may need to:
# 1. Ensure you have the correct access rights to the repository
# 2. Set up authentication using a personal access token or SSH key

# For personal access token (HTTPS), use:
git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME:TOKEN@github.com/USERNAME/flower-classification.git

# OR for SSH authentication (recommended), use:
# First, ensure you have an SSH key set up with GitHub, then:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/flower-classification.git
```

## 3. Verify Repository

After uploading, verify that all files are correctly uploaded to your GitHub repository:

- README.md
- app.py
- train_flower_classifier.py
- requirements.txt
- flower_classifier.h5
- confusion_matrix.png
- class_confidence.png
- training_history.png
- model_metrics.json
- training_history.json
- flowers/ directory (if you want to include the dataset)

## 4. Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to create a project website:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the 'GitHub Pages' section
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually 'master')
4. Choose the root folder
5. Click 'Save'

Your project will be available at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/flower-classification`

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Permission Denied (403) Error

If you see a "Permission denied" error when pushing to GitHub:

1. Check that you have the correct access rights to the repository
2. Verify your GitHub authentication is set up correctly
3. Consider using a personal access token or SSH key for authentication

### Branch Name Issues

If your local branch name doesn't match the remote branch:

1. You can rename your local branch: `git branch -m old-name new-name`
2. Or push to a specific remote branch: `git push origin local-branch:remote-branch`

### Other Common Issues

- **Changes not showing up**: Make sure you've committed your changes with `git commit`
- **Merge conflicts**: Resolve conflicts in the affected files, then commit the changes
- **Large files**: Consider using Git LFS for large files like models or datasets
