## 📋 Overview

Blossom AI is a deep learning project that classifies five types of flowers (daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip) using a convolutional neural network. The project includes both a model training script and an interactive web application for real-time flower classification.

## ✨ Features

- **Advanced CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a deep CNN with residual connections for improved accuracy
- **Data Augmentation**: Implements comprehensive image augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness
- **Interactive Web UI**: Beautiful Streamlit interface with modern design elements
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides confidence scores, color analysis, and image properties for each prediction
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Visualizes training history and confusion matrix
- **Prediction History**: Keeps track of previous predictions during the session

## 🌸 Flower Classes

- 🌼 **Daisy**: Simple white petals with yellow center
- 🌻 **Dandelion**: Bright yellow composite flower
- 🌹 **Rose**: Classic layered petals, often red or pink
- 🌻 **Sunflower**: Large yellow petals with dark center
- 🌷 **Tulip**: Cup-shaped flower with smooth petals

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:true-de/flower-classification.git
   cd flower-classification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Model

To train the flower classification model:

```bash
python train_flower_classifier.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the flower dataset
- Apply data augmentation
- Train the CNN model
- Save the trained model as `flower_classifier.h5`
- Generate performance visualizations

### Running the Web Application

To launch the interactive web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server, and you can access the application in your browser.

## 📊 Model Architecture

The model uses a CNN architecture with:
- Multiple convolutional blocks with batch normalization
- Residual connections for better gradient flow
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Global average pooling
- Dense layers with ReLU activation
